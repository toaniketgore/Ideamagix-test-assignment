# Ideamagix-test-assignment
AAFIYA MEDIRETREATS is a web project that I developed as part of an interview assignment. It includes three navigation bars, six sections, two footers, and various complex elements. Although it's a work in progress, I've put in significant effort, working for approximately 20 hours, to create a solid layout and structure for the website.
